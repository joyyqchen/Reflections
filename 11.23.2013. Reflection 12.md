This week we received feedback about our individual and group survey responses that was much appreciated. I brought up a couple concerns in my individual evaluations and Kristina more than adequately addressed them. I think it was helpful for Aaron and the GSIs to have us fill out a group Google Doc that outlined our group process and timeline for our tasks. It helped clarify the timeline my group will be following and makes available information about what other groups are planning on doing. This way, if I need additional information from another group, I don't need to go search up who is in which group, then search for a person's contact information to ask them a question about their work.

My group is so far on schedule, although we do project to have roadblocks down the line as we work more with the R packages and D3. I think between the 2 programs, we will have the most trouble with D3 because no one really has any previous experience with it. Thus, we will face a very steep learning curve using it. We planned a "back-up plan" in case things don't work out with D3: we will take the "main idea" behind the visualization we were intending to create with D3 and attempt to portray the same idea with multiple visuals using a program we are proficient with.
