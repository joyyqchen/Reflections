This week during class, we discussed how we would be creating our final deliverables. We are planning on presenting at the Data Science Fair on Thursday and we are going to create 3 different posters to display at the fair: 1 on reproducibility, 1 on class management, and 1 on the earthquake "science." I am working on both the reproducibility and class management posters and am working with the respective groups on each one to make sure it will be completed by Thursday.

I spoke to Aaron during office hours on Friday to discuss some things about the class and gave some feedback about how to improve it. I suggested that in the future the professors and GSIs should first determine what project the class will adopt and what end result should be achieved. This would eliminate a lot of the confusion that we experienced this semester.
