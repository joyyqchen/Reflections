Due to Thanksgiving break, we only had class on Tuesday this week. On Tuesday, we had a phenomenal talk given by the "father" of iPython Notbook, Fernando Perez. I really enjoyed listening to his presentation, and seeing how powerful of a tool the iPython Notebook really is. I especially was fascinated by how you can make a function, graph, etc. interactive and can alter the outputs in real time by dragging a sliding bar.
