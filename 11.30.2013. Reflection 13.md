Due to Thanksgiving break, we only had class on Tuesday this week. On Tuesday, we had a phenomenal talk given by the "father" of iPython Notbook, Fernando Perez. I really enjoyed listening to his presentation, and seeing how powerful of a tool the iPython Notebook really is. I especially was fascinated by how you can make a function, graph, etc. interactive and can alter the outputs in real time by dragging a sliding bar. I didn't fully recognize how many possible functions and uses the iPython Notebook is capable of until Fernando's presentation on Tuesday. It was very eye-opening. As far as visualization work is going, our group is currently working on creating a histogram visualization of the alarm time windows. I am curious, is there a team that is assembling the final "poster" that we're planning on presenting on December 12th?
