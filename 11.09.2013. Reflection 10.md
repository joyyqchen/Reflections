We spent a good amount of time this week figuring out how to go about coordinating ourselves as a class to get this project finished. Before, I was very confused as to what we were doing and who we were working with but after this week I feel better and more confident about my role and how each group in the class will be working with others to produce a final product.

I had one concern I did bring up to Aaron during class on Thursday. That is, I hope that the students taking more of a "doing"/"background" role would be recognized equally for their contributions compared to those students who are currently taking on a more "over-looking"/"managing" role. Because those students don't work directly with Aaron as much, it may be harder for Aaron and the GSIs to see how they are contributing directly.

Other than that, my group is currently discussing which graphs we should make with the data we will be getting from Roland's analyzer group. We are making proxy graphs with made-up data to test if the code we have works and once we get the real data, we will plug it into our pre-made functions and hopefully come out with some cool graphs!
