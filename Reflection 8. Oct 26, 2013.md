Reflection October 26, 2013
===========
I feel like the assignment due this week was highly unfair to the students that have little to no computer science background. Quoting one of my group members, "If I did not have CS as my second major, I would have no idea what we are supposed to be doing with this." It is really frustrating to see an assignment that basically assumes you know what a 'dictionary' is and which functions in Python to use to parse data with.

In class, we don't really cover 'the basics', code syntax, functions, or uses of the program we are supposed to be using, and that does not translate well when I get an assignment such as this one. I spent so much extra time just trying to teach myself the code and the syntax of Python before I could even start touching the assignment. I also feel like the computer science majors are carrying a large weight on their shoulders in that they are indirectly tasked with 'teaching' those with little CS knowledge how to do the assignment. I scheduled office hours with Aaron to discuss these issues and bring to his attention my concern about them.
