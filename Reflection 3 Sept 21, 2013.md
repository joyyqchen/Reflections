This week focused less on the software programs we were working with in previous weeks. I really enjoyed listening to
the talk on Tuesday concerning the Yosemite toads. I was wondering how the things we were learning to use in class
would relate to actual 'real-world' projects, and the presentation was an excellent example of how everything is 
relevant. 
<br>
I found the analysis on the relationship between horse packs and toad breeding particularly interesting.
I expected the data to confirm that the packs were indeed negatively impacting toad breeding, but was pretty surprised
to hear that the data supported the opposite outcome. I'm curious to see what the actual ruling in the legal case concerning
will turn out to be.
<br>
Philip's presentation on statistical analysis and earthquake predictions was also very engaging and relevant (considering
we live in earthquake central). Some of the things he mentioned were a bit complex, and I needed to take some time to
refresh all of the statistical concepts and jargon I learned before to fully understand what he was talking about.
<br>
Overall, I think this past week was a great way to 'mix things up' and have a change in lesson plans to see how the things
we are learning in class can be applied to projcets that analyze things that happen in the real world.
