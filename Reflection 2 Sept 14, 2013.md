Some roadblocks I ran into this week involved using Vagrant and the Ubuntu Server/VirtualBox. 
Last week, I thought I had installed the correct Ubuntu Server until I realized later during class that
I had downloaded the desktop version rather than the server one. With some help from the instructors and technical leads,
I was able to fix the issue and get the proper Ubuntu server functioning. There were also some issues installing Vagrant
and getting it to run in my computer, as I did not understand what the program was and what its functions were. 
I did a little research about Vagrant online and was able to get a better understanding of how it interacted with my
computer and with the VirtualBox. 

<br>
One thing that I was a bit confused about this was when to use the terminal in the VirtualBox or GitShell/cmd 
to issue commands. I initially tried to launch Vagrant using the VirtualBox terminal and later discovered that was not
the correct way to initiate Vagrant as VirtualBox began to spin out a bunch of different messages which didn't seem right.
I later realied that we need to use GitShell or cmd to do this and that we would be working from this terminal to interact
with the various other programs.

<br>
One potential issue I forsee is how quickly I will be able to learn how to use VirtualBox/GitShell/cmd because I am not 
very familiar with the UNIX language. There will be a bit of a learning curve there for me to understand and familiarize
myself with the different commands as well as the structure of the language itself. Nonetheless, I am excited to learn how 
to use UNIX and I know I have various resources such as the IRC terminal, the internet, StackOverFlow, and the instructors
to help me along the way should I get stuck.
