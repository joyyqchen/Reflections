This week was a working week. During class, we met with our groups and discussed what action steps to take towards the final goals. Our group is working on visualizations and is currently looking to understand how D3 and special visualization packages in R can help us. One concern: during class on Tuesday, Carl brought up how Luen sent over code that he used previously for his visualizations on the MDA model. This is problematic because that was originally our task. I think it's great for us to have the code first-hand that produced the visualizations, but given that he's done this is my group's task now insignificant/irrelevant since we technically already have the graphs? Should we produce some more graphs of our own that are original? Or should my group look to work on something else?

Looking ahead, we need to start synthesizing all the information, data, and visualizations we have made in our individual groups into an iPython Notebook. We should start looking into this process and begin assigning people tasks to get it compiled. I am willing to be a part of the team that does this. Aaron mentioned in office hours that he and the GSIs would look over this process, but it would be great if we could be a part of that action.
