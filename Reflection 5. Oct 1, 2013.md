It was great this week that we are actually getting an opportunity to use the tools we have been talking about in class through the assignment. However, there are a lot of things about this assignment that I feel like could use improvement. First, the way the assignment was thrown at us was not ideal. We were given this assignment with the assumption that we understand how to use the tools i.e. iPython Notbook to create the desired results. I feel very much like I'm teaching myself how iPython works before I can get to doing the actual assignment. I assumed the opposite, that we were going to learn the fundamentals of the programs first in class before we would start applying their uses.

I hope during class we can spend time learning how to use core programs (i.e. what are some main functions and code commands) we will be using for projects in the class. We spent a great deal of time this week talking about communication and how to work in groups, and, although I find those discussions helpful, I feel like such discussions could be held on our own. Those are things we can figure out for ourselves. Learning iPython solo, not so much. A good majority of students in the class have little to no programming background. We would really benefit from the knowledge the instructors have about the programs, and I would really like to start using classtime to learn about them.
