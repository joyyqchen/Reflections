<b>What are your thoughts on reproducibility? For it or against it?
<br>
What logical reasons do you have to be for it or against it?
</b>
<br>
Before this class, I had never really considered the concept of reproducibility or its importance as I haven't previously worked in many environments that actually emphasize using collaborative data science techniques. I think reproducibility in theory is a very beneficial thing in that it allows entire communities to access and understand information on a single standard/structure. I work as an undergraduate researcher on campus and it is rather frustrating trying to synthesize information when other members of the team perform data analysis in different programs and then organize the results in an unstandardized method. I can't easily interpret the information because I can't understand how it was produced in the first place. In situations like this, I think reproducibility is very important and should be emphasized as it would increase the overall efficiency and knowledge of those trying to work together

<b>What is the strongest justification for the opposite view?</b>
<br>
I mentioned that <i>in theory</i> reproducibility is a good thing, but the main issue with the idea is that many people  actively <i> don't want </i> things to be easily reproduced and make efforts to ensure so. Program and software developers may not want their work reproduced and shared in open source communities as they would no longer be able to make money if that were to happen. Professors who publish research want to make sure it is original and that other professors cannot obtain their methods all that simply. Thus, even though reproducibility would make many aspects of data science more efficient, it may not be practical in reality as people and organizations have conflicting interests and may not be seeking to improve the state of the overall community.
