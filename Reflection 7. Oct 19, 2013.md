I really appreciated this week how Aaron and the instructors used Tuesday's class to teach us the technical basics about the actual programs we will be using. I feel like the majority of students in class have little to no experience or knowledge of the programming tools we are using, thus such basic instruction is really helpful. I remember on Tuesday when Aaron started mentioning how a problem could be easily resolved using Javascript and no one in the class knew what he was refering to because not very many people have worked with Java. I think as the class progresses it is important to remember that point and hopefully transform that initial "I have no idea how to use this program" sentiment into one of familiarity.

Regarding the assignment due on Monday, I think this homework assignment is more reasonable in terms of what it is asking us to do. However, I still think the deadline is a bit tight. I hope in the future, we can receive the assignment on Thursdays/Fridays and have them be due the Monday 9 days later so we have two possible weekends to schedule office hours with Aaron. This way Aaron will have less of a giant influx of people last minute on the Saturday/Sunday before since people will be spread out over the course of 2 weekends.

During class we discussed how we can improve how we work within our vertical groups, and we are implementing those changes by communicating and starting the homework earlier rather than later. Additionally, we did manage to receive another group member so we are no longer working with one man down which will really help our process.

For lecture on Thursday with Philip Stark, I found myself having a hard time following what Professor Stark was talking about. He shoots information at us very quickly often mentioning advanced statistics models that most of us have never heard of.
