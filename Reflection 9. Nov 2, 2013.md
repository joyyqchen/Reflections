I am having a hard time understanding where we are going with this current "project." We spend a lot of class time talking about abstract ideas of how to work on it and which processes to take, but we never spend any time discussing the actual <b>content</b> of the project itself.
<br><br>
On Tuesday during class, there was a point where Aaron asked us to write an <i>Abstract</i> for this paper. I think everyone was taken aback when they heard this because usually the abstract is written after a paper is complete as it gives a concise summary of its contents. We neither have a paper, nor even have a concrete idea of what this project looks like, and thus writing an abstract is not sensical.
<br><br>
One of my main goals for this class was to learn how to code in Python and the other programming tools we've come into contact with. Unfortunately, per Aaron's comments about the class, I will not have the opportunity to learn these things during class because this "is not a programming class." For me to learn how to program/code, I will have to schedule office hours with Aaron (most likely on the weekend). If I do not have time on the weekends, how will I be able to learn these things? For those who want to learn how to code (which I think is a large majority of the class), we will need to set aside time for "more class" (essentially) on the weekends?
