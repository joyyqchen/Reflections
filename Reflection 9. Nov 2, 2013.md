During class this week, we talked about how to work on our project and which processes to take. I wish we spent more time discussing the actual content of the project itself (what is our thesis? what is the new model we're creating? how do we create it?. I think once we get started on the actual material, we will naturally be able to figure out how to work together as a group and will run into roadblocks that we can't really predict right now.
<br><br>
One of my main goals for this class was to learn how to code in Python and the other programming tools we've come into contact with. For me to learn how to program/code, I will have to schedule office hours with Aaron (most likely on the weekend). I will really make the effort to make time for it, but inevitably, some weekends I just won't have tha time. If this is the case, it is going to be really difficult for me to learn these things. I foresee this as a future roadblock.
