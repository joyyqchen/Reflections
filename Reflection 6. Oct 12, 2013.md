It was exciting this week working with my group and creating a presentation in iPython Notebook. I had no previous exposure to iPython Notebook and spent a significant amount of time first understanding how to use the program and learning the Python language itself. One of the biggest challenges our group faced was that we were working one man down the entire time. <br><br>
I enjoyed listening to each of the different presentations and noticed that overall each group came up with similar conclusions about the data. However, there were very diverse visualizations despite the fact that the data set was not very large and the amount of visual analyses that we could do was limited. 
<br><br>
I hope for future presentations to have a more concrete set of directions on what we are supposed to do so that we have a better sense of what exactly we need to accomplish.
