This week, the most challenging road block was the initial learning curve required to familiarize myself with the
dozens of different software and blogging/chat programs we needed to download and use. It was a bit overwhelming trying
to digest everything at once. The best solution to this road block for me was listing out every different program we
needed to learn about and re-organizing the ‘next steps’ we needed to take by program. This way, I could sequentially
complete the tasks for one program before moving onto the next. Also, using the Pigin Plugin to chat with the instructors
and fellow classmates online has been very helpful in resolving the issues I ran into along the way.

One exciting “Aha!” moment I had this week was when I discovered how to change the virtualization settings in the
BIOS of my computer in order to have Oracle VirtualBox functioning properly. Originally, I had no idea what a computer
BIOS was and did not have the slightest idea on how to alter its settings. My first reaction was to ask Aaron on IRC
for step-by-step directions on how to fix it. Since my computer is different from his and has its own set of controls
and functions, he couldn’t give those explicit instructions for me. He referred me to a few webpages and suggested I
do some personal digging and research into the topic online. I followed his advice and did eventually find helpful
information on how to change settings in my BIOS. Going through this process I realized if I did run into a road block,
there are so many resources available for me to exploit to get the answers I need. I can be proactive and first research
for things on my own before “taking the easy route” by immediately asking the instructors or fellow classmates to
resolve the situation for me.
